# ✂️ Short URL Generator 🚀

Welcome to **Short URL Generator**, an open-source project designed to help you master modern web development tools and workflows! 🎉

## 🧑‍💻 About This Project

This repository is a **learning playground** for:
- 🐍 **Django** — Web framework for rapid development
- 📦 **Django ORM** — Powerful database management
